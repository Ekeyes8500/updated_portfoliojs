# portfolio-update1

#Completed:
-Updated existing html and css to make a much better looking site
    -Bootstrap used with a mostly full contrast black/white color pallete
    -classes, spacing, and card makeup cleaned up heavily
    -navbar made sticky
    -site layout totally revamped

-Used javascript to enhance functionality
    -Links at the top now scroll you to a particular part of the page, rather than having three separate pages
    -Portfolio items dynamically generated, filters can be added to filter projects, depending on what employer is looking for
    -Email logo links to the client's email application to send email to me

#Todo:

-Clean up github profile
    -I still have some work to do in terms of cleaning up my github account, but in all reality: I feel that I'm finally at the point where I could actually contribute to public repos and the like.
